# Documenting components
The Logiq library uses Storybook's [DocBlocks functionality](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/doc-blocks)
to document components. This means that the documentation stays close to the component since it's written
in comment blocks instead of a seperate `.md` file.

## Writing a component description
You can add a description for your component by adding a comment block above your component, like so:
```jsx
// AwesomeComponent.jsx

// ... imports etc.

/**
 * This is a description for my awesome component
 */
const AwesomeComponent = ({ someProp }) => (
  <div>
      {/* ... some content */}
  </div>
);

// ....
```

## Documenting props
Since we're using Storybook's DocBlocks you have to make use of `React.PropTypes` to document the type your prop has to be.
On top of that you can add a description by again, writing a block comment above your prop, like so:
```jsx
// AwesomeComponent.jsx

// ... your JSX code

AwesomeComponent.propTypes = {
    /**
     * This prop brings the awesomeness to the component
    */
    someProp: PropTypes.string.isRequired
}

// ... export of your component
```
