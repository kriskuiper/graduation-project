# About the Logiq component library
The Logiq component library provides you with the base UI-components used by OrangeTalent to build the most accessible and performant websites. 
The source code of the library is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kriskuiper/graduation-project). If you want to work on the library
you can clone the library from there.

## Writing documentation
You can learn about how to document components on a seperate page: [Documenting components page](?path=/docs/01-this-library-documenting-components--page).

## Installation
The Logiq component library is available through NPM, you can install it on your project by running:
```bash
npm install @logiq/library
```

## Usage
You can import a component from the library by simply using destructuring. Replace `ComponentName` with the name of the component you want to use.
```jsx
import { ComponentName } from '@logiq/library';
```

After importing a component you can use it in every place you want, just like this:
```jsx
import { ComponentName } from '@logiq/library';

const SomePage = () => (
    <>
        <h1>Page title</h1>
        <ComponentName someProp={someValue} />
    </>
);
```
